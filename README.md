# Overview
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock is an entertaining game of chance that offers a fun twist on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this expanded version, players choose from five options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The computer opponent also makes a random choice, and the user interface displays the outcomeâ€”whether the user wins, loses, or draws. Additionally, the game features score tracking, allowing users to keep a record of their wins and losses over multiple rounds. The player has the option to play again after each round.
